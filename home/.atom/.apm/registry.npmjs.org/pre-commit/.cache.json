http://img.shields.io/coveralls/observing/pre-commit/master.svg?style=flat-square\n\n**pre-commit** is a pre-commit hook installer for `git`. It will ensure that\nyour `npm test` (or other specified scripts) passes before you can commit your\nchanges. This all conveniently configured in your `package.json`.\n\nBut don't worry, you can still force a commit by telling `git` to skip the\n`pre-commit` hooks by simply committing using `--no-verify`.\n\n### Installation\n\nIt's advised to install the **pre-commit** module as a `devDependencies` in your\n`package.json` as you only need this for development purposes. To install the\nmodule simply run:\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev pre-commit\n```\n\nTo install it as `devDependency`. When this module is installed it will override\nthe existing `pre-commit` file in your `.git/hooks` folder. Existing\n`pre-commit` hooks will be backed up as `pre-commit.old` in the same repository.\n\n### Configuration\n\n`pre-commit` will try to run your `npm test` command in the root of the git\nrepository by default unless it's the default value that is set by the `npm\ninit` script. \n\nBut `pre-commit` is not limited to just running your `npm test`'s during the\ncommit hook. It's also capable of running every other script that you've\nspecified in your `package.json` \"scripts\" field. So before people commit you\ncould ensure that:\n\n- You have 100% coverage\n- All styling passes.\n- JSHint passes.\n- Contribution licenses signed etc.\n\nThe only thing you need to do is add a `pre-commit` array to your `package.json`\nthat specifies which scripts you want to have ran and in which order:\n\n```js\n{\n  \"name\": \"437464d0899504fb6b7b\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"ERROR: No README.md file found!\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: I SHOULD FAIL LOLOLOLOLOL \\\" && exit 1\",\n    \"foo\": \"echo \\\"fooo\\\" && exit 0\",\n    \"bar\": \"echo \\\"bar\\\" && exit 0\"\n  },\n  \"pre-commit\": [\n    \"foo\",\n    \"bar\",\n    \"test\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, it will first run: `npm run foo` then `npm run bar` and\nfinally `npm run test` which will make the commit fail as it returns the error\ncode `1`.  If you prefer strings over arrays or `precommit` without a middle\ndash, that also works:\n\n```js\n{\n  \"precommit\": \"foo, bar, test\"\n  \"pre-commit\": \"foo, bar, test\"\n  \"pre-commit\": [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"test\"]\n  \"precommit\": [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"test\"],\n  \"precommit\": {\n    \"run\": \"foo, bar, test\",\n  },\n  \"pre-commit\": {\n    \"run\": [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"test\"],\n  },\n  \"precommit\": {\n    \"run\": [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"test\"],\n  },\n  \"pre-commit\": {\n    \"run\": \"foo, bar, test\",\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe examples above are all the same. In addition to configuring which scripts\nshould be ran you can also configure the following options:\n\n- **silent** Don't output the prefixed `pre-commit:` messages when things fail\n  or when we have nothing to run. Should be a boolean.\n- **colors** Don't output colors when we write messages. Should be a boolean.\n- **template** Path to a file who's content should be used as template for the\n  git commit body.\n\nThese options can either be added in the `pre-commit`/`precommit` object as keys\nor as `\"pre-commit.{key}` key properties in the `package.json`:\n\n```js\n{\n  \"precommit.silent\": true,\n  \"pre-commit\": {\n    \"silent\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt's all the same. Different styles so use what matches your project. To learn\nmore about the scripts, please read the official `npm` documentation:\n\nhttps://npmjs.org/doc/scripts.html\n\nAnd to learn more about git hooks read:\n\nhttp://githooks.com\n\n### License\n\nMIT\n","maintainers":[{"name":"swaagie","email":"info@martijnswaagman.nl"},{"name":"3rdeden","email":"npm@3rd-Eden.com"},{"name":"v1","email":"info@3rd-Eden.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-05-10T13:31:57.288Z","created":"2013-04-10T11:03:29.595Z","0.0.0":"2013-04-10T11:03:31.478Z","0.0.1":"2013-04-10T15:35:11.370Z","0.0.2":"2013-04-10T17:32:27.175Z","0.0.3":"2013-05-02T15:45:36.080Z","0.0.4":"2013-06-27T13:01:50.207Z","0.0.5":"2014-04-02T07:28:51.618Z","0.0.6":"2014-04-10T18:14:44.273Z","0.0.7":"2014-04-10T21:34:15.602Z","0.0.8":"2014-06-17T08:37:19.215Z","0.0.9":"2014-06-26T08:54:17.567Z","0.0.10":"2015-01-15T08:22:10.530Z","0.0.11":"2015-01-16T18:40:12.488Z","1.0.0":"2015-01-30T20:40:22.806Z","1.0.1":"2015-01-30T21:20:16.597Z","1.0.2":"2015-02-02T11:58:19.442Z","1.0.3":"2015-02-13T08:44:30.827Z","1.0.4":"2015-02-14T17:50:44.383Z","1.0.5":"2015-02-24T23:21:47.920Z","1.0.6":"2015-03-05T18:29:58.495Z","1.0.7":"2015-04-28T07:01:25.521Z","1.0.8":"2015-06-09T15:59:48.460Z","1.0.9":"2015-06-10T09:49:52.276Z","1.0.10":"2015-06-10T12:45:25.302Z","1.1.0":"2015-07-31T09:12:56.940Z","1.1.1":"2015-07-31T12:15:21.135Z","1.1.2":"2015-10-20T09:19:35.686Z","1.1.3":"2016-05-10T13:31:57.288Z"},"author":{"name":"Arnout Kazemier","email":"opensource@observe.it"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/observing/pre-commit.git"},"users":{"aredridel":true,"maxogden":true,"stdarg":true,"oroce":true,"rubenverborgh":true,"nelsonic":true,"atheken":true,"alanshaw":true,"growlybear":true,"roylines":true,"blakeembrey":true,"codeshrew":true,"sasquatch":true,"zckrs":true,"jerome.d.russ":true,"baishuiz":true,"jacoborus":true,"qqqppp9998":true,"dani.raja":true,"popico":true,"mattonfoot":true,"wfcookie":true,"boton":true,"r3nya":true,"fibo":true,"brunocalou":true,"nelix":true,"moimikey":true,"lcdss":true,"docksteaderluke":true,"danielbayley":true,"hengkiardo":true,"goliatone":true,"croogie":true,"xuhong":true,"luispablo":true,"wangnan0610":true,"monolithed":true,"csbun":true,"rbultitude":true,"jayiitb":true,"yinyongcom666":true,"randallagordon":true,"amibug":true,"joeattardi":true,"styxnp":true,"nichoth":true},"readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/observing/pre-commit","keywords":["git","hooks","npm","pre-commit","precommit","run","test","development"],"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/observing/pre-commit/issues"},"license":"MIT","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"5RINLJVRZ6WFF4GU4PG96DOGJ\""}
