It __tones down__ less important parts (like punctuation and brackets) and highlights only the __important__ ones. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.\n\n### Currently tested and optimized for these languages:\n\n- C\n- CSS\n- CoffeeScript\n- GF Markdown\n- Go\n- HTML\n- JSON\n- (La-)TeX\n- Less\n- Perl\n- PHP\n- Python\n- Ruby\n- SASS\n- SCSS\n- XML\n- YAML\n\nMore optimization to come..\n\n> ps.
